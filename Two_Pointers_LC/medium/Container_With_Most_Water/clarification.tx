When height[l]==height[r]
it doesn't matter whether we move the left pointer or right pointer
because we already obtained the max value for that height and doesn't matter if we  move to a shorter or 
longer height it will give a lesser volume anyway in the next itteration when calculating the value
with the height of the pointer we didn't change.
